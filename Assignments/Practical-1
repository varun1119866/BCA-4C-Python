# 1.1 WAP to Calculate Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle

def calculate_rectangle(length, width):
    area = length * width
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    return area, perimeter
length = 5
width = 10
area, perimeter = calculate_rectangle(length, width)
print(f"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.")
print(f"The perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter} units.")


# 1.2 WAP to calculate Avg. marks of 3 subjects

def calculate_average(marks1, marks2, marks3):
    total_marks = marks1 + marks2 + marks3
    average_marks = total_marks / 3
    return average_marks
marks1 = 85
marks2 = 90
marks3 = 95
average_marks = calculate_average(marks1, marks2, marks3)
print(f"The average marks of the 3 subjects is {average_marks}.")


# 1.3 WAP to compute compound Interest

def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n):
    compound_interest = principal * (1 + rate / (100 * n)) ** (n * time)
    return compound_interest
principal = 5000
rate = 5
time = 10
n = 12
compound_interest = calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n)
print(f"The compound interest is {compound_interest}.")
