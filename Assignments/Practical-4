Practical 4 – While and For loops – Repetition Control Statements
4.1 WAP to show working of a while Loop with a text
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print("Hello, World!")
    counter += 1

4.2 WAP to show working of a while Loop with a Numbers	
counter = 1
while counter <= 10:
    print(counter)
 
counter += 1
4.3 WAP to show the working of break and continue statement
counter = 1
while counter <= 10:
    if counter == 5:
        break
    if counter % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
4.4 WAP to the use of else statement with while and break
counter = 1
while counter <= 10:
    if counter == 5:
        break
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
else:
    print("The loop has completed successfully")

4.5 WAP to compute the Sum of the Series 4 + 8 + 12 + … + 40
sum = 0
num = 4
while num <= 40:
    sum += num
    num += 4
print(sum)

4.6 Write a program to display the Fibonacci sequences up to
nth term where n is provided by the user.
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
a, b = 0, 1
while a < n:
    print(a)
    a, b = b, a + b

4.7 WAP that prints multiplication table of a umber using for loop.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")

4.8 WAP To print a Triangle Pattern
n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print("*" * i)

4.9 WAP to compute Sum of the series 3 + 6 + 9 + … + 30
sum = 0
start = 3
end = 30
while start <= end:
    sum += start
    start += 3
print("The sum of the series is:", sum)

4.10 WAP to print the product of the series m = 15 * 13 * 11 * 9 * 7
product = 1
numbers = [15, 13, 11, 9, 7]
for num in numbers:
    product *= num
print(product)

4.11 WAP to compute factorial of a Number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial *= i
print(factorial)

4.12 WAP to display the Cube of first 10 even numbers
def compute_cube(n):
    return n**3

for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        cube = compute_cube(i)
        print("Cube of", i, "is:", cube)

4.13 WAP to compute sum of first n natural numbers
def compute_sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i
    return sum
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
sum = compute_sum(n)
print("Sum of first", n, "natural numbers is:", sum)
4.14 WAP to display 1 to 10 numbers in reverse order
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
4.15 WAP to create a list of any specific size. Arrange all the
elements in ascending order. Display list before and after sorting
n = int(input("Enter the size of the list: "))
my_list = []
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input(f"Enter element {i + 1}: "))
    my_list.append(num)
print("List before sorting: ", my_list)
my_list.sort()
print("List after sorting: ", my_list)
